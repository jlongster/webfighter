# Web Fighter

This is an example [open web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps) that implements some nifty features like [in-app payments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Publishing/In-app_payments)

Take a look at the source to see a working example of charging money for an in-app product. You can [install](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/webfighter?src=search) the app from Firefox Marketplace to play the game and see it in action. If you are using a device that supports payments (such as a Firefox OS device) then you can visit the shop section and make a purchase.
